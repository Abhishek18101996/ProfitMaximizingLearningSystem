# ProfitMaximizingLearningSystem

## Problem Statement

A wireless company with 10 million customers is planning to launch a smartphone upgrade program in order to earn additional profits.
<br>
The company's marketing team has organized 8 different marketing campaigns, each of which offers customer specific features, promotions, or discounts to try to entice them to upgrade.
<br>
The company knows how much profit it will make per sale for each advertising campaign, but it does not know how effective each campaign would be.

## Goal 
Implement an AI system that can maximize the company's profits for its smartphone upgrade program.

#### We have generated the expected profit per trial for all the 8 advertising campaigns. It comes out that the campaign index 3 will generate the maximum profit above all followed by campaign index 6 anf campaign index 5<br>
#### This information is not known to our AI system and is for only purpose of validating the results generated by our AI system
